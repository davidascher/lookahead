TODO

=== p1

* implement move:
  - keyboard UI first // finish player 2 side, and figure out player turn issues
* determine end-of-game test, offer to restart
* figure out edge-case guards until hitbox issues are resolved, so the ball can never escape the playground.
* mouse/touch UI instead of kbd.
* disable disabled guns
* add bullet count to each gun
